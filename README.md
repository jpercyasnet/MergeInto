# mergeinto
Rust-Iced program that merges images into another folder.
I converted one function in photoomc04 from using gtk4 to iced.
Iced is still being developed so code may change over time.
Merges images in a folder into another folder one by one.

This program calls winitsize01 to get the smallest monitor size.
